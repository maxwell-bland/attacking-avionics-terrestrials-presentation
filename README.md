Material and notes relating to a depth subject discussing the threat vector
differences between air and ground cyber-physical systems (CPS).

What are the similarities and differences in adversary models and attacks for
flying vehicles (e.g. aircraft and drones) vs terrestrial vehicles
(automobiles, trucks, unmanned rovers)? 
To the extent possible, discuss past, current and future trends. 

# Earth and Wind: Flying and Terrestrial Vehicles, Adversary Models and Attacks

First, definitions.

## What do we define as a vehicle?

A mobile machine, i.e. any object capable of coordinating itself in space according to a set of inputs. 

Flying: a vehicle coordinating itself in the atmosphere. 
Terrestrial: a vehicle coordinating itself on the ground.

## What do we define as an adversary?

All objects are considered inputs to the material reality of the vehicle.
Material realities may be considered as being or not being.
Adversaries are a continuum of causal priors to oppositional material realities.
That is, they are the cause behind some continuum of material oppositions to other states of being.
Note that these oppositions (attacks) are states of being in themselves.
Adversaries are also material themselves, and thus restricted.

For examples, an adversary can be the environment itself.
An adversary could also be a hacker capable of hijacking control flow.

## What do we define as an attack?

An attack is the potential material consequence of the adversary.
For an attack to be considered valid, we must percieve its oppositional material reality.
The material of an attack can be abstract or real. 
When abstract, it is an organization of material signifiers parrallel to other material. 
When realized, it is occuring: for example, the radio signals as they take over an aircraft.

TODO: Below this. Now that key terms are defined, I will define  current
conceptions of adversaries and attacks in relation to air and ground vehicles. 

## The Similarities Between Air/Ground CPS

Consider that both air and ground CPS are "machines" with material outputs, inputs.
Consider that in both cases there are tight environmental timing constraints.
Consider that both air and ground CPS will use programmable microcontrollers, embedded RTS.
Potentially entire operating systems: at the end of the day, these are computers.

## The Differences Between Air/Ground CPS

Aircraft, drones have greater degrees of mobility in their route planning. 
They may also deal with mobility-based defense mechanisms, i.e. dodging missiles.
To an extent, terrestrial vehicles may also need to dodge threats.

Crucially, the greater degree of mobility is one categorical dissimilarity between air and terrestrial vehicles.

## Historical Context

Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) have gained traction.
False Data Injection (FDI) attacks the null space of CPS matrix computations. 
FDI circumvents error detection techniques in sensor technologies.

Artificial neural network technologies can detect abnormal fluctuations in sensor values.

Work in the domain of mobile systems is ultimately work in non-mobile systems. 
E.g. my work on analyzing the update mechanisms for aircraft, other work on EV power stations.
